# DeepLearningFinalProject

Final Project: 50%. Teams of 4. 
The project includes a report and presentation
40% of the project grade will be from the presentation. These should be submitted as a video. We would like to share these with the entire class, so while they do not need to be public, there should be a way to share them with the class. 
60% of the project grade will be from the report. The reports will also be due on the evening of Sunday, March 13. 
Project proposal -- whoâ€™s on your team, what you want to do and with which data set(s) you plan to use. Due Date: Friday, March 2nd
